# Music-Classifier-using-CatBoost
This project builds a machine learning model to classify GTZAN audio tracks into genres. After preprocessing with standardization and label encoding, class imbalance is handled via sample weighting. Using CatBoost, a gradient boosting model, the system achieves strong classification performance across genres.
